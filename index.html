            The two restaurants sell pizza very differently, but both have had to adapt their methods because of the pandemic. Tony's is a slice shop that has been in the neighborhood for over 45 years. Historically, it has relied on pick-up and
            take-out.
            Tony's
            was able to stay open during the pandemic. Santa Panza, on the other hand, has only been around for five years. It is a sit-down family dining spot with a wood fire oven inside that could not sustain
            itself
            at the
            start of the pandemic. Santa Panza closed for three months and recently reopened with garden seating. It is now relying on take-out to break even, but the management worries that if indoor dining does not take off they will face difficult
            choices
            in
            the
            winter.

              Indoor dining will allow the restaurants to open with 25% capacity beginning on September 30th. For Tony's, this is mostly good news. The shop has some booths inside for seating, but it is a counter service only restaurant. Indoor
              dining will not make a huge impact on the shop's revenue stream since the store had adopted to the delivery style early on.
              But it does mean the owners can finally open a second location that they have delayed since May. For Santa Panza, it's a slightly different story. Santa Panza has 20
              tables
              in their restaurant and 25% would mean it can only have five
              tables
              with
              customers.

              “If we have zero indoor dining, and it’s too cold for any outdoor seating, we would probably last a few months, but it would be miserable,” said Evro Schwebel, manager at Santa Panza.

              Both restaurants are having difficulty keeping up with changing regulations. Heating Ventiliation and Air Conditioning Systems, known as HVAC Systems, will need to be up to the new city codes. Tony's owner, Salvatre Polizzi, said he has
              been
              doing his best to keep up with guidelines, but the restaurant has receieved warnings about compliance. A violation could cost the restaurant up to $10,000. Santa Panza is also facing increased costs due to regulations. Unlike Tony's,
              where the owners also own the building, more than 50% of Santa Panza's revenue goes to paying their rent. Now, the store will also have to update their HVAC systems, especially because they have a wood fire oven in the restaurant that
              requires more ventiliation to prevent from over-heating. The expense is another reason the management is hoping indoor dining will be expanded so they can offset those costs.

            <p> Despite facing hardship, both Tony's and Santa Panza have been helping the community and the restaurant's workers. Santa Panza has donated tables and chairs to a group of Bushwick locals that gather in the empty commercial building
              next door
              to help those in need make it through the pandemic. Tony's has partnered with organizations like Breaking Ground. Breaking Ground serves more than 8,000 New Yorkers in need with their programs. Tony's helps the organization support the
              homeless outside the restaurant
              find shelter and food. At Santa Panza, where workers were furloughed for three months, the owner has been supporting employees that did not qualify for governmental financial assistance. The restaurant managers are hoping that indoor
              dining will bring help for their restaurants, workers, and the community around them. </p>
